=========

This repository is a simple program that collect different gauge data and store them in influxdb.  
We also provide API and example to acquire data.  
All gauges are installed on the roof top of the Civil Engineering Research Building ([CERB](https://goo.gl/maps/cPMwUBwyFxDYLgTM7)) in National Taiwan University.

How to get data from our server.  
----------------------------------
In this [Influxdb official tutorial](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.6/query-data/), there is a complete tutorial showing how to query data from influxdb.  

## Gauges information
